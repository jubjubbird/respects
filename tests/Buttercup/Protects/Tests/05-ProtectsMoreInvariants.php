// - An event is recorded. The type and the payload of the event, depend on the state of the Aggregate at the moment.
// - Multiple events are recorded (less common, but it can be useful if you need more granularity.)
// - An exception is thrown.
// - Nothing happens at all. This is a perfectly legal outcome. We'll work through a simple example.
