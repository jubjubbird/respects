// **An invariant is a statement about the domain that holds true, no matter what**. By enforcing invariants, we ensure
// **consistency** in the domain model. This allows us to write code in all the layers that surround our model, without
// having to worry about this consistency. Arguably, protecting invariants is one of the most important aspects of
// building models, which is of course why this library is called *Buttercup.Protects*. But, ironically, the library
// doesn't offer much help to actually protect invariants. Most likely, this is because invariants are very specific to
// a particular domain anyway.
